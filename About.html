  <p>About Glazed Over<br />
  <small>Growing up, I looked forward to eating my Italian grandmother's fritti every year on Christmas morning. I would watch her form the dough into balls, then fry them in honey, ready to be devoured by a swarm of children. In addition, I am a native Washingtonian who was exposed to international cultures and cuisines at a young age. Glazed Over is born out of a love for both of these things. My goal is to expose people to new experiences- and familiar tastes. From Kenyan mandazi to Austrian krapfen, there's something for everyone. <br>
Buon Appetito!<br>
